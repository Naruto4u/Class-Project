Browser limitations and compatability issues.

#### Web browser apps can differ based on the code they use and the organizations that develop them. Not all browsers interpret code the same way; depending on their design, some may break due to how a websiteâ€™s code is organized or compiled. In some cases, websites might look entirely different depending on how browsers process the code. These differences can impact site performance but are often addressed through future updates.
#### An example would be a IoT application performing as expected in the supported browser, firefox, but you not being able to select any options in google chrome.
