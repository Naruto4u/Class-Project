Browser limitations and compatability issues.

#### Web browser apps can differ based on the code they use and the organizations that develop them. Not all browsers interpret code the same way; depending on their design, some may break due to how a websiteâ€™s code is organized or compiled. In some cases, websites might look entirely different depending on how browsers process the code. These differences can impact site performance but are often addressed through future updates.
#### An example would be a IoT application performing as expected in the supported browser, firefox, but you not being able to select any options in google chrome. 

#### Browser limitations and compatability issues both come from the server side code that is run in order for the browsers to function. Depending on how the language works, it can slow down websites and max out website memory, which can break different functions that require information to be temporarily stored on your device.


## Relation to other web topics:
### How do web servers and the programming behind websites affect how well browsers work?
  - Website programming (code) can determine how the browsers render sites and can be interacted with.
  - older browsers might not support modern architecture and will fail to load newer sites or programs
### What happens in a browser can't support an IoT dashboard or app?
  - Functions in the IoT dashboard won't work, and might not load
  - the dashboard will have issues, inputs might not work, layouts may be broken, etc..
  - the user will have to determine the issue and fix it by either updating or finding a compatable browser.
### How do slow internet speeds or big files make browser problems worse?
  - Slow speeds/high data usage can slow down other website functions, and cause issues loading page content
  - Browsers can crash upon handling large files, especially with processing power limited devices
  - It can ruin the overall browsing experience
